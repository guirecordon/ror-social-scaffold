## About

This project creates an application that allows new users to sign up,an existing user can sign in, see all users, send a friend request, cancel request approve or reject a request, create post(s), comment on his/her post(s) as well as others, like his/her post(s) plus for others.We used many-to-many relationships.

, 
We started the project by setting up the following. 

* Modeled the data for the application, including the necessary tables.
* Built and migrated the Friendship model with associations and all requested features for friendships.
* Made a logged-in user to be able to do the following:
    * see all users lists
    * select user page with their user name and all posts written by them (the most recent posts on the top
    * able to send a friendship invitation.
    * able to see a button ‚ÄúInvite to friendship‚Äù next to the name of user who is not my friend yet - on both users‚Äô list and single user page.
    * able to see pending friendship invitations sent to me from other users.
    * able to accept or reject friendships invitation.
    * able to create new posts (text only).
    * able to like/dislike posts (but I can like single post only once).
    * able to add comments to posts.
    * able to see ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù page with posts (with number of likes and comments) written by me and all my friends (the most recent posts on the top).
        Timeline page should be the root page of the app.
